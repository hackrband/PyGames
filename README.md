# PyGames

A collection of Python games built using **Pygame**, organized into chapters for structured learning and fun.

## Contents

- **Chapter01/** – Introduction to Pygame. Likely contains starter games or minimal examples to get your feet wet.
- **Chapter02/** – Intermediate Pygame concepts. Possible expansions on Chapter01 or brand-new mini-games.
- **test.py** – A general-purpose script, potentially for running or testing one of the games.

*(Note: If you'd like, I can take a closer look at the contents of these folders to add more specific descriptions.)*
